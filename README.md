## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The application developed here takes two texts as input in a web service and produces text similarity between them on a scale of 0 to 1. 

Here's what it does:
* If the two texts are exactly same meaning all the words are same in both the texts. Then the output will be 1.0.
* If the two texts are different, then it calculates similarity and outputs the similarity score
* If the two texts don't have any common words, it produces 0.0 as the output score.
